monarchy model originally developed in Britain. Nowadays a parliamentary democracy that is a constitutional monarchy is 
considered to differ from one that is a republic only in detail rather than in substance. In both cases, the titular 
head of state—monarch or president—serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the 
government is carried on by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected Members of Parliament. However, three important 
factors distinguish monarchies such as the United Kingdom from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with 
Parliament. These are: the Royal Prerogative under which the monarch may exercise power under certain very limited 
circumstances; Sovereign Immunity under which the monarch may do no wrong under the law because the responsible 
government is instead deemed accountable; and the monarch may not be subject to the same taxation or property use 
restrictions as most citizens

In the constitutional monarchy established under the Constitution of the German Empire which Bismarck inspired, the 
Kaiser retained considerable actual executive power, while the Imperial Chancellor needed no parliamentary vote of 
confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However, this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and 
abolished following Germany's defeat in the First World War. Later, Fascist Italy could also be considered a 
constitutional monarchy, in that there was a king as the titular head of state while actual power was held by Benito 
Mussolini under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After
 the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional
